## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Parse Douyin JSON
The system SHALL parse JSON files generated by Apify's Douyin Scraper into structured objects.

#### Scenario: Successful Import
- **WHEN** a valid Douyin Scraper JSON file is provided
- **THEN** the system extracts `id`, `url`, `text`, `playUrl`, and `statistics` (likes, shares, collects) for each entry

### Requirement: Filter Videos
The system SHALL support filtering videos based on engagement metrics during import.

#### Scenario: Filter by Likes
- **WHEN** the user specifies a minimum like count (e.g., 1000)
- **THEN** only videos with `statistics.diggCount` >= 1000 are retained
